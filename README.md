# Resturant-SPA
This is a single page application (SPA) that allows to search and order food in nearby restaurants. The interesting thing about this project is that it is designed in 2010, when SPA libraries were just emerging.<br />  <br />
You can find its demo on: [resturant.tantaneh.com](http://resturant.tantaneh.com)  <br />
Note that the full features of the site can only work on a PC browser (Chrome or Firefox) and it does not work on mobile. So that you can easily scroll different foods by mouse wheel button.
